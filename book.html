          Raksha Bandhan is a day that fills my heart with warmth and nostalgia. I find myself reminiscing about the countless moments we've shared, each one contributing to the unbreakable bond we have today. You’ve always been there, not just as a sister, but as someone who understands me in ways no one else can.
        </p>
        <p>
          You've always had my back, no matter the situation, and that sense of security you provide is something I cherish deeply.
           It's comforting to know that no matter what challenges life throws our way, we’ll face them together, just as we always have.
          </p>

            You are more than just a sister; you are my best friend, my advisor, and my biggest supporter. I couldn’t imagine my life without you in it. As we tie the rakhi this year, I pray that our bond continues to grow stronger and that you are blessed with all the happiness in the world.
            <p>You are My Everything 💖</p>
